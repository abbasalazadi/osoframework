This tutorial explains how to create a new web robot using OsoFramework.


== Adding references to a new project ==

Create a new solution and project from Visual Studio.NET or Mono Develop. Add the following references:

 * `log4net (found in Third Party folder)`
 * `System.Configuration`
 * `System.Linq`
 * `System.Xml`
 * `OsoFramework`

Following the `OsoExamples` project organization, add a `DatabaseSchema` folder, which stores the database schemas and Robot folder, storing the robots.
